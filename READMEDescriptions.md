##PM MODULES
Modules refer to distinct parts of an application that each handle a specific function or feature. 
Think of them as building blocks of your appâ€”each module works independently but also connects to others to form the complete system.

In the context of the Property Mkononi app, examples of modules include:
###1.User Authentication Module
Handles login, registration, password reset, user roles

###2.Property Listings Module
Allows users to view, search, and filter properties

###3.Property Management Module
Lets landlords or agents upload and manage their properties

###4.Booking/Inquiry Module
Enables users to express interest or book viewings

###5.Payments Module
Manages rent collection, payment tracking, or integrations with mobile money

###6.Admin Dashboard Module
Internal tool for managing users, listings, and reports

###7.Notifications Module
Sends alerts via email, SMS, or in-app notifications

###8.Reports & Analytics Module
Shows data like property views, bookings, or revenue

####Note: Each module can often be developed and tested on its own, which helps in organizing work among team members and tracking progress clearly.
